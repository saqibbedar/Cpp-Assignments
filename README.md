# C++ Assignments
This repo is all about the assignments, I did in my first semester in the Problem Solving &amp; Programming (PSP) course. 

The assignment was given from chapter 5 of "A First Book of C++" by [Gary_J._Bronson].
Exercise: 5.2 and 5.3

<h3>Note:</h3>
Assignment answers are not verified, I have solved them based on my logic so their answers may be varied.
