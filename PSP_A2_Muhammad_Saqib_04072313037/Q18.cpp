/*
18. (Program) Write, compile, and run a C++ program that calculates and displays the yearly amount available if $1000 is invested in a bank account for 10 years. Your program should display the amounts available for interest rates from 6% to 12%, inclusive, in 1% increments. 

Use a nested loop, with the outer loop having a fixed count of 7 and the inner loop having a fixed count of 10. The first iteration of the outer loop should use an interest rate of 6% and display the amount of money available at the end of the first 10 years. In each subsequent pass 
through the outer loop, the interest rate should be increased by 1%. Use this relationship: money available at end of each year = amount of money in account at start of the year + interest rate Ã— amount available at start of the year.
